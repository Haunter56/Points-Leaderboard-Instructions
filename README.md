In the file, put the `leaderboard-websocket-version` folder in a place where you can keep it and reference it later.

## **Add the Browser Source to OBS**

In a scene create a browser source and name it.

In the properties, check the box for `Local file`

Then update the file location to the `index.html` file that you saved earlier

## **Import Streamer.bot code**

Now get the `points_leaderboard.sb` file and import it into Streamer.bot

Should be just 1 action and 1 command.

You can test it out by right-clicking the Test trigger and selecting `Test Trigger` and you should see the browser source update.


From there you can add some sub-actions to make the browser source visable for a few seconds, and then invisible or whatever you want to do. :)
